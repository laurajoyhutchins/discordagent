# Discord Agent Runtime Architecture

Discord Agent is a private, local-first Discord workspace with one persistent PM-style primary agent and isolated Claude or Codex task agents. Generic orchestration depends only on provider-neutral contracts.

## Runtime topology

```text
#agent-chat
  → PrimaryAgentService
  → bounded context (pinned memory + projects + active tasks + recent/FTS history + usage posture)
  → TaskCoordinator for approved delegation

project #agent / task thread
  → TaskCoordinator
  → UsageAdmissionService
  → WorktreeManager + SQLite task/worktree/session records
  → ProviderRegistry
      ├── ClaudeProvider → Claude Agent SDK
      └── CodexProvider → local Codex App Server JSON-RPC
  → normalized events → SQLite + DiscordTaskRenderer
  → durable status transitions → optional TaskControlSurface
```

## Task lifecycle

A new task follows this order:

1. resolve the project and immutable provider;
2. verify provider availability and authentication;
3. reserve estimated provider capacity;
4. create the Discord thread;
5. create an isolated Git branch/worktree;
6. persist task/worktree and attach the reservation;
7. start the provider;
8. persist the provider session before awaiting completion;
9. stream redacted normalized events;
10. persist the terminal result and calibrate actual usage;
11. refresh the thread's provider-neutral task control card after each durable transition.

Admission happens before Discord or Git side effects. A rejected task creates neither a thread nor a worktree. Continuations reserve a new turn budget while retaining the same task, provider session, branch, and worktree. A message context action may supply an existing project-channel message as the objective, but it still enters through the same coordinator boundary.

`TaskControlSurface` is an optional frontend port. Its Discord implementation upserts one control message per task thread by stable task-scoped component IDs. It reads `TaskRecord` and `TaskResult` only; control-message failures are logged after redaction and never change task state or provider execution.

## Providers

`ClaudeProvider` uses user-level Claude settings only. Project/local settings remain excluded.

`CodexProvider` uses one local App Server transport. It supports initialization, account state, device-code login, thread start/resume, streamed items, approvals, user questions, rate-limit windows, bounded overload retry, interruption, and deterministic shutdown. Requests blocked by authentication are held in memory for up to 30 minutes and require an explicit post-login Start action before Discord or Git side effects occur. Credentials and one-time codes never enter SQLite.

A provider switch is a confirmed sibling handoff. The system estimates target input context, requires confirmation, creates a fresh target session and isolated worktree based on the clean committed source branch, and cross-links the threads.

## Primary agent

The primary agent is deliberately tool-isolated. It can converse, retrieve history, propose decisions, write provenance-valid memory, and delegate through `TaskCoordinator`; it cannot edit repositories or call project MCP tools directly. Raw messages remain authoritative in SQLite, with FTS5 retrieval and bounded context assembly. Read-only policy memory cannot be overwritten by model output.

## Usage orchestration

Provider windows and reset times are stored as snapshots. Each task class has a low/high estimate calibrated from completed observations. Active holds are included when computing safe capacity, with a configurable reserve for primary-agent coordination.

Operating postures are `unknown`, `healthy`, `cautious`, `restricted`, `preserve`, and `exhausted`. Routine messages hide telemetry. When capacity is critical, the coordinator records a checkpoint and interrupts the provider at most once for that turn; task state, session, branch, and worktree remain available. `/usage` and `/agents` expose details on demand.

## Recovery and safety

Startup marks nonterminal tasks interrupted and never replays a possibly side-effecting turn. Recovery posts a checkpoint and refreshes the task control card so **Inspect** reflects the durable interrupted state. Dirty worktrees are never force-removed. Provider events and errors are redacted before persistence, Discord, and logs. Git commands use argument arrays with `shell: false`. Roborev posts through the authenticated bot and stores no webhook credentials.
